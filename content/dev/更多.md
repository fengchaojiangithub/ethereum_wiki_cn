## Summary

Ethereum is a blockchain, first-and-foremost. Its primary artifact is the smart contract, written in the programming language Solidity, a language with syntax similar to JavaScript. Currently Vyper is being developed to offer another choice when developing smart contracts, with syntax similar to Python.

### Languages

Solidity - Most commonly used language.
